## Personal Vocal Assistant
The idea is to create a personnalized vocal assistant. To be shure personal data are yours, i wanted to make something simple by using a dictionnary storing datas from a .txt register in the same folder. 

In fine, i would like to run this code on a rasberry pie and complete it as much as possible

... For the moment it's only the beginning and there is only my initial commit ...
